# livability-app
Liveable communities app

This application was originally implemented by Ben Krepp using OpenLayers 2.11. It was subsequenlty migrated to read data from JSON and CSV files (rather than making WFS requests) and render it using the D3 library by Ethan Ebinger. As it would be difficult (and quite time consuming) to reconstruct the revision history of the first version of this app, the code for the second version is being put into this repo.

This application was 'retired' some time ago. The code is being committed to GitHub for the benefit of anyone who might want to study it in future.

THe application makes use of the following external resources

* Version 1.7.1 of the jQuery library
* Vesrion 4.8.0 of the D3 library
* The d3-tip library
* Version 3.0 of the topojson library
* Version 1.9.4 of Dirk Ginader's accessible tabs library
* The CTPS accessible grid library (in a separate repo)
* The CTPSutils library (in a separate repo)
* The SimpleSlidingDoors CSS framework
